## Versioning

[SemVer](https://semver.org/) is used for versioning.
For the versions available, see the [tags on this repository](https://github.com/adamjarret/shortid-dist/tags). 

## Releasing

The `npm version` and `npm run links` commands both accept a semver argument:
`<newversion>|major|minor|patch` (where `<newversion>` is a standard version number, ex. 1.0.0).
See [npm-version](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/version) for more information.

Examine what will be included in the npm bundle:

    npm run pack

Update the links in the **README.md** and **index.html** files (and commit the changes) _before_ running `npm version`:

    npm run links -- patch
    git add README.md index.html
    git commit -m "Updated links"

Bump the version number in **package.json** and create a git tag:

    npm version patch

Publish a new version:

    npm publish
    git push origin master --tags
